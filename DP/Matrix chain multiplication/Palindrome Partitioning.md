# Palindrome Partitioning
Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "aab"
Output: 1
Explanation: The palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.

Example 2:
Input: str = "ababbbabbababa"
Output: 3
Explaination: After 3 partitioning substrings 
are "a", "babbbab", "b", "ababa".

Example 3:
Input: str = "aaabba"
Output: 1
Explaination: The substrings after 1
partitioning are "aa" and "abba".
```
